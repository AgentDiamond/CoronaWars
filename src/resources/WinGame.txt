        CONGRATULATIONS!!!

You saved the world ...

but your leader has taken all the credit!

To prevent "fake news" from suggesting
otherwise, he's packed you off for a
lifelong holiday at a little resort
he knows of on the south coast of Cuba.

Sounds lovely!

It's called Guantanamo Bay!!

Never mind. Life doesn't always
turn out as you planned!
